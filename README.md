# Frontend Challenge Conexa

## Project Overview

This repository is my solution to the Frontend Challenge provided by Conexa. The project aims to implement a given design using React, with all data fetched from a web server. The challenge focuses on code organization, coding standards, project structure, maintainability, documentation, and automated tests.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **json-server**: A full fake REST API for prototyping and mocking.
- **Jest**: A testing framework for JavaScript.
